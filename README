# Expert-system: Guess the capital

## What is this?

Expert-system written in prolog. The expert-system will guess what capital in Europe you are thinking of by asking you a few questions. The expert system comes with a web-interface. Everything is developed in swi-prolog.


## Current state

A majority of the capitals in Europe is supported but some are still lacking.
The system is not optimized (minimal number of guesses needed for each capital), that is left to do.

## How to use

### Compile

```prolog
['server'].

```

### Run
```prolog
server(8000).

```

Now point your browser to: http://localhost:8000/
